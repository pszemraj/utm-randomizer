# Privacy Policy

**UTM Randomizer** is designed with privacy as a core principle.

## Data Collection

This extension **does not collect, store, or transmit any user data**. Specifically:

- No personal information is collected
- No browsing history is recorded
- No data is sent to external servers
- No analytics or telemetry is used
- No cookies are set by the extension

## How the Extension Works

When you copy a URL to your clipboard, this extension:

1. Reads the clipboard content locally in your browser
2. Checks if the URL contains tracking parameters (UTM codes, click IDs, etc.)
3. Replaces those parameters with random nonsense values
4. Writes the modified URL back to your clipboard

**All processing happens entirely within your browser.** The extension makes no network requests.

## Permissions Used

- **clipboardRead**: Required to detect when you copy a URL with tracking parameters
- **clipboardWrite**: Required to replace the tracking parameters with randomized values

These permissions are used solely for the extension's core functionality.

## Open Source

This extension is open source. You can review the code at any time to verify these privacy claims.

## Contact

If you have privacy concerns, please open an issue on the project's GitHub repository.
